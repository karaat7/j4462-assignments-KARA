The project that I decided to go with is the News Shaman tool built by Texas Tribune developers. The tool, which is described as a “mood ring for your stories,” analyzes multiple stories to compare their emotional content. The results for that particular set of stories are then summarized to generate an “overall series aura” and “overall series mood.” While presented in kind of a silly manner, I chose this project because it seemed pretty novel and the basis for something that could maybe be used in a genuinely series manner by newsrooms. Having a tool to gauge the tone and emotional leaning of an article through text analysis could maybe help reporters and editors predict the audience response to their stories.

As for developer questions, I’m foremost really interested in learning why they decided to build this tool. I see that it was created during The Huffington Post and Change.org Editors Lab event/hackathon, which was based around prototyping news innovation. From there, I’d like to know what sort of algorithm or other method they are using for the story text analysis in order to detect sentiment. Also, is there a max out point for a particular story length? I noticed that when I played with the tool, certain stories took longer than others. However, if I pulled in, say, Paul Ford’s mammoth “What is Code?” essay, would that stop News Shaman in its tracks. Lastly, I’d ask the developers if they have any plans to further iterate and make this into either a newsroom- or consumer-facing analysis tool.
